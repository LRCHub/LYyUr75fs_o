```lrc
[00:08.04] You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
[00:12.09] She's going off about something that you said
[00:15.82] 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
[00:37.32] 
[00:22.64] I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
[00:26.98] I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
[00:30.65] And she'll never know your story like I do
[00:51.65] 
[00:37.24] But she wears short skirts
[00:39.53] I wear T-shirts
[00:41.48] She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
[00:44.95] Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
[00:47.95] That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
[01:16.45] 
[00:51.97] If you could see that I'm the one
[00:54.42] Who understands you
[00:56.01] Been here all along
[00:58.11] So, why can't you see?
[01:01.94] You belong with me
[01:05.56] You belong with me
[01:14.56] 
[01:10.92] Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
[01:14.83] I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
[01:18.63] Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
[01:22.51] Hey, isn't this easy?
[01:33.01] 
[01:25.67] And you've got a smile
[01:27.32] That can light up this whole town
[01:29.63] I haven't seen it in a while
[01:31.63] Since she brought you down
[01:33.38] You say you're fine, I know you better than that
[01:36.65] Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
[01:57.65] 
[01:40.29] She wears high heels
[01:42.14] I wear sneakers
[01:44.09] She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
[01:47.67] Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
[01:50.88] That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
[02:19.38] 
[01:54.58] If you could see that I'm the one
[01:57.60] Who understands you
[01:59.03] Been here all along
[02:01.37] So, why can't you see?
[02:04.46] You belong with me
[02:13.46] 
[02:09.76] Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
[02:13.51] All this time how could you not know, baby?
[02:19.54] You belong with me
[02:23.12] You belong with me
[02:32.12] 
[02:37.47] Oh, I remember you driving to my house
[02:40.81] In the middle of the night
[02:42.75] I'm the one who makes you laugh
[02:44.68] When you know you're 'bout to cry
[02:46.53] And I know your favorite songs
[02:48.39] And you tell me 'bout your dreams
[02:50.15] Think I know where you belong
[02:51.86] Think I know it's with me
[03:04.36] 
[02:55.71] Can't you see that I'm the one
[02:58.38] Who understands you?
[02:59.77] Been here all along
[03:01.89] So, why can't you see?
[03:05.61] You belong with me
[03:14.61] 
[03:10.30] Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
[03:14.42] All this time how could you not know, baby?
[03:20.39] You belong with me
[03:24.26] You belong with me
[03:33.26] 
[03:28.02] You belong with me
[03:30.73] Have you ever thought just maybe
[03:35.25] You belong with me?
[03:38.90] You belong with me
